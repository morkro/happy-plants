## Data structure
In the application settings, you can download and import your plant data.

### Basic plant data
This is the minimum required data of a single plant. If you want to import the data, it should be an Array of objects.

```typescript
{
  "guid": String, // [required] A random, version 4 GUID
  "created": Date, // [required] Date when the plant has been created
  "modified": Date, // [required] Date when plant has been modified, defaults to created date
  "name": String, // [required] Name of the plant
  "blob": Blob | Base64 | undefined, // [optional] A base64 encoded or Blob of the plant photo
  "categories": Array<Category> // [optional] Array of categories, defaults to []
  "modules": Array<PlantModule> // [optional] Array of plant modules, should default to []
}
```

### Category data
A plant can be assigned to various, user created, categories. A category object should be defined as follows:

```typescript
{
  "guid": String, // [required] A random, version 4 GUID
  "created": Date, // [required] Date when the plant has been created
  "modified": Date, // [required] Date when plant has been modified, defaults to created date
  "name": String, // [required] Name of the category
}
```

### Plant Modules
Modules have all the same structure with a module-specific `value` definition.

#### Watering module

```typescript
{
  "type": "watering",
  "value": {
    "level": 5
  }
}
```

#### Sunshine module

```typescript
{
  "type": "sunshine",
  "value": {
    "insensity": 1 | 2 | 3
  }
}
```

#### Seasons module

```typescript
{
  "type": "seasons",
  "value": {
    "seasons": [
      {
        "month": "January",
        "growth": Boolean
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```
