When is it dormant? Does it require lots of sun?_ Basically, creating your own plant database in a visual way. You can either save HappyPlants to your homescreens on mobile devices (recommended) or add it to your bookmarks on desktop.

## Data structure
In the application settings, you can download and import your plant data.

### Basic plant data
This is the minimum required data of a single plant. If you want to import the data, it should be an Array of objects.

```typescript
{
  "guid": String, // [required] A random, version 4 GUID
  "created": Date, // [required] Date when the plant has been created
  "modified": Date, // [required] Date when plant has been modified, defaults to created date
  "name": String, // [required] Name of the plant
  "blob": Blob | Base64 | undefined, // [optional] A base64 encoded or Blob of the plant photo
  "modules": Array<PlantModule> // [optional] Array of plant modules, should default to []
}
```

### Tag data
A plant can be assigned to various, user created, tags. A tag object should be defined as follows:

```typescript
{
  "guid": String, // [required] A random, version 4 GUID
  "created": Date, // [required] Date when the plant has been created
  "modified": Date, // [required] Date when plant has been modified, defaults to created date
  "name": String, // [required] Identifier name of the tag
  "label": String, [required]
  "plants": Array<guid> // [required] A list of plants associated with the tag
}
```

### Plant Modules
