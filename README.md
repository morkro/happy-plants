## 🛠 HappyPlants v2 in development!

HappyPlants v2 is currently in development. It will be a complete rebuild from scratch, eliminating some early architectural design decision issues. **HappyPlants v2** will be **managed as a monorepo**, to make migration easier I've already moved the current version to this setup using Lerna.

You can follow the progress on the [**v2 project board**](https://github.com/morkro/happy-plants/projects/6). I am currently finalising the new design and features.

[_HappyPlants_](https://happyplants.garden) is all about collecting, organising, and adding all kinds of information of your little friends. _How much water does it need? During which seasons does it grow? When is it dormant? Does it require lots of sun?_ Basically, creating your own plant database in a visual way. You can either save HappyPlants to your homescreens on mobile devices (recommended) or add it to your bookmarks on desktop. This is a mobile-first, progressive web application.
